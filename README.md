# RosterReady Frontend: Final Year Project

## Project Overview
**RosterReady** is an automated scheduling application designed to help teams and organizations generate optimal schedules based on various factors like employee availability, shift preferences, and other user-defined constraints. The goal of this project is to streamline and automate the scheduling process, making it more efficient and eliminating manual errors.

This repository represents the **frontend** part of the RosterReady application. It provides an interactive and user-friendly interface where users can input their preferences, manage schedules, and view generated shift plans. The frontend communicates with a FastAPI-powered backend to handle data and provide the necessary functionality.

## In Development!!!

## Technologies Used
- **Vite**: A modern, fast build tool that provides a fast development environment.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used to style the application.
- **ShadCN**: A component library for UI components, integrated with Tailwind.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests to the backend.
